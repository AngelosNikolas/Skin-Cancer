### Skin-Cancer
This project focuses on image classification of various classes of skin cancer. Machine learning techniques can
identify texture features from these images and provide numerous advantages in the field. The need of this
project is the exploration of the techniques used in the field, define best practises and compromises to ensure
the best possible results.

The objective of this project is to explore the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset with a set of appropriate
tools, study what affects classification accuracy and apply a model to classify the various categories included
within this dataset. Machine learning and specifically deep learning is a very powerful tool for medical image
analysis. In healthcare these techniques are proved to be very useful, some examples are maintenance of
accurate data, forecasting illness, detection of types and personalization of treatments. It goes without saying
that deep learning has drawbacks and weaknesses as well therefore researching and developing projects such as
this is crucial to refine and cultivate understanding on this particular aspect of machine learning.
